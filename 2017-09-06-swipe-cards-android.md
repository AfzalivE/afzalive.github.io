## Swipe cards from scratch on Android

Recently, I wanted to build something that leveraged the stacked cards swiping paradigm that we've seen in Tinder and Google's own Primer app. Of course, there were quite a few libraries which tried to solve this problem very easily but I was curious about how I would go about implementing such a thing without those libraries.


## Initial commit

Let's start by creating a new project. We're going to use the Basic Activity template, just so we can also use the included FloatingActionButton when we need to.
