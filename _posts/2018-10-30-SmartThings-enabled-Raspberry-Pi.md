## Create a SmartThings enabled Raspberry Pi

So you've got SmartThings and you've got a Raspberry Pi controlling some things in the house. Wouldn't it be great if you could use the Pi with Smart Things and, in turn, get all the Google Home/Alexa/Homekit control by simply implementing one API?

Yup, that's what we're going to do today. It's nice to know some Groovy and some Python for this one.


- Setup the Raspberry Pi
- Setup a Device Handler in SmartThings IDE
- Initial Goal: Turn a switch off and on
- Second Goal: Subscribe to changes in switch state
- Third Goal: Make the Pi discoverable
- Fourth Goal: Use EventGhost and control a Windows computer with voice!
