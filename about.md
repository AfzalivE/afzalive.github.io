I'm an Android developer who loves basketball. I currently work at [NortonLifeLock](https://nortonlifelock.com/), mostly on the [Norton Secure VPN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.symantec.securewifi) app. I live in Toronto, Canada. You can reach me through [these platforms](#contact-me)

I like building mobile applications and I love contributing to open source software in my spare time. Some of the projects I've contributed to in the past include:

- [Mozilla Firefox on Android](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AAfzalivE+is%3Aclosed)
- [Spyder IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/pull/8222)
